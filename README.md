# chip8emul8or
This is an emultator for CHIP8, that I wrote just as an experiment.

# What works:
1. Everything except sound.

# How to use it
It requires SDL 2.0. 
Update code to match the name of the BIN file you will be using for emulation. Compile, place the BIN file in the same folder as the excecutable and run.
